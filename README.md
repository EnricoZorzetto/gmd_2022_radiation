# gmd_2022_radiation

Codes used for analyzing the sub--grid distribution of solar radiation over mountains

The analysis in the paper can be replicated using the script
 

codes_gmd/main_run_gmd_2021_combined.py

The computing environment (tested on a Mac OS computer) can be built using Conda e the yaml file env_rad_macos.yml

The code will need to point to a user-specified directory USERDIR with the data:

    - $USERDIR/gmd_2021/gmd_2021_data/gmd_2021_grids_light
    - $USERDIR/gmd_2021/gmd_2021_data/output_cluster_PP3D_EastAlps_merged123456
    - $USERDIR/gmd_2021/gmd_2021_data/output_cluster_PP3D_Peru_merged123456

A directory with the results will be created in $USERDIR/gmd_2021/gmd_2021_output/

Code used to construct the domain (stored in gmd_2021_grids_light) and to simulate the radiation fields (stored in output_cluster_PP3D_*) is included in GFDL_preprocessing and rmc directories, respectively.
