Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.

ORTE does not know how to route a message to the specified daemon
located on the indicated node:

  my node:   nid00226
  target node:  nid00241

This is usually an internal programming error that should be
reported to the developers. In the meantime, a workaround may
be to set the MCA param routed=direct on the command line or
in your environment. We apologize for the problem.
